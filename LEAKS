###############-TO_DO-#####################

Signals (ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl-\)
2 option: 
	heredoc - with get_next_line: (branch - main_test)
		ctrl-\ >> doesn't ignore the signal, it shows the signal sign, wich doesn't make affect the process,
				  BUT every time if we send a ctre-\ signal in the hd, (even if several other cmd are entered)
				  at the end of the process, it shows Core dumped!!! >> according to ChatGPT in gnl we can not fix this
		ctrl-C >> if we in a child process, like enter only "cat" or "wc" this doesn't exit the right exit code...

		only 156 error, no leaks as I tested it...

	heredoc - with readline: (branch - main_test_HDW_readline)
		ctrl-l >> works perfectly fine in hd, i didn't test any other option
		ctrl-C >> not work in hd

		206 error, no leaks as I tested it...
